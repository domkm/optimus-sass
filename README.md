# optimus-sass

A [Sass/SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) asset loader for [Optimus](http://github.com/magnars/optimus) based on [optimus-less](https://github.com/magnars/optimus-less).


## Usage [![Current Version](https://clojars.org/optimus-sass/latest-version.svg)](https://clojars.org/optimus-sass)

`require` `optimus-sass.core` in the namespace where
you're loading assets. That's it. You can then load `.sass` and `.scss` files just as you would load `.css` files.
